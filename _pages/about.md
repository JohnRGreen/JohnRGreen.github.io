I am a 5th year student in the Ph.D. Economics program at Johns Hopkins. I work broadly in structural labor, with specific interests in education and subjective beliefs (which form the focus of my job market paper). Most of my projects involve structural models, but I am also interested in causal inference and machine learning.

As part of my dissertation work, I began a survey on beliefs and expectations at a large MD community college. Through this work, I have developed a keen interest in survey methodologies; the community college survey is in its second year, and two other projects in non-community college contexts are in early stage development.
